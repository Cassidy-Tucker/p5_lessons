# P5 Lessons

The following collection of p5 sketches and documents is meant to lead a new programmer through the basics, from sketching basic shapes, to adding motion, to creating data visualizations using API connections. 

## About p5.js

p5.js is a JavaScript library used for graphics, animation, and sound. It is based on Processing, a language that has gained popularity in the creative coding and audiovisual art community. 

## Setting up 

The only thing that you will need to get these examples working is the p5 library. Download from [the p5.js website.](https://p5.js)

You will want to place the entire p5 directory at the `root` of this repository. 

### Running the sketches

I won't make it difficult or force you to set-up much. Just drag the index.html in each lesson to the browser. The code you need to edit is in the corresponding `js` folder.

## Drawing

While learning basic functionality in p5.js, we will also go over some general JavaScript basics.

1. [Drawing basic shapes](/1_drawing/1_1.basic-shapes)
2. [Create shapes WITH LOOPS](/1_drawing/1.2_shapes-w-loops)

## Motion

As we start to use motion in some of our sketches, we will dig further into loops, objects, arrays, among others.

1. [Playing with the draw loop]()
2. [Make a geometric tunnel]()
3. [Create a car]()
4. [Create a meteor shower]()

## Math

If you want to learn programming, you are going to have to build at least a friendly attitude towards math. We will create a series of rules, and figure out how to implement them.

1. [Following rules]()
2. [Create a radiant sun]()

## Interaction

Start thinking about the person using what you're making.

1. [Make a typing sketch]()
2. [Positive and negative feedback]()

## Data Visualization

And now combine it all.

1. [Working with data]()
2. []()
3. []()
